    <h2> ⌖𓄃 Purpose of This Guide</h2>
    <div class="scroll-box">
      <p>
        This website serves as a literary guide to
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Song_of_Achilles" target="_blank">
          <em>The Song of Achilles</em>
        </a>
        by Madeline Miller. Inspired by the tradition of medieval manuscripts,
        the guide presents the text as a story passed down through time, shaped
        by memory, retelling, and interpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through the use of <strong>hypertext</strong>, readers are able to move
        beyond the novel itself and explore related myths, historical epics,
        and cultural ideas. At the same time, <strong>intertext</strong> reveals
        how Miller’s novel is deeply connected to earlier works such as Homer’s
        <em>Iliad</em>, showing how ancient stories continue to evolve.

    <h2> ⋆✴︎˚｡⋆ Why This Story Endures</h2>
    <p>
      Like legends preserved in medieval chronicles, the story of Achilles
      survives because it speaks to universal human experiences. Love, fate,
      honor, and loss are themes that remain meaningful across centuries.
      By retelling Achilles’ story through Patroclus’s voice, Miller shifts
      the focus from heroic glory to emotional truth.
