    <h2> 𓂀 A Key Quotation</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “I am made of memories.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This quotation captures one of the novel’s central ideas: that identity
      is formed through relationships and shared experiences rather than
      physical strength or fame. Even after death, Patroclus’s memories
      continue to define who he is.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a broader sense, the line reflects how stories themselves survive.
      Much like medieval chronicles, memories preserve lives long after they
      have passed, allowing love and meaning to endure beyond mortality.
