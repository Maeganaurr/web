    <h2> 𓅓 Pastiche</h2>
    <div class="scroll-box">
      <p>
        Achilles stood beneath the open sky, his future already shaped by
        prophecy and expectation. At his side remained Patroclus, whose quiet
        presence reminded him of a life beyond war. Though songs would one
        day praise Achilles’ strength, it was love that gave meaning to his
        choices.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Explanation:</strong> This pastiche imitates Madeline Miller’s
        lyrical style, focusing on introspection and emotional connection
        rather than heroic action. The tone reflects her emphasis on humanity
        over legend.

    <h2> ⋆˚༊·˚ Retelling</h2>
    <p>
      This retelling presents the Trojan War through Patroclus’s experience,
      reshaping the conflict as a story of personal sacrifice rather than
      military triumph. Events traditionally celebrated for their heroism
      are reframed to highlight their emotional cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      By shifting perspective, the retelling challenges traditional ideas of
      glory and suggests that love and loyalty are as powerful as strength
      on the battlefield.
    </p>
    <p>
       Madeline Miller uses retelling to shift the perspective of the Trojan War narrative to Patroclus' point of view. In the original Illiad, Achilles is described as proud, ego-driven, violent, and fierce--defined largely by his honor. Rarely being depicted as soft or shy. In The Song of Achilles, however,  Miller reinterprets Achilles' character, presenting him as loving, kinder, more morally reflective and emotionally open. Because the novel is written as if Patroclus himself is the one retelling the story, the portrayal of Achilles  feels more deeply personal and intimate almost as if it was seen through rose colored glasses, formed by Patroclus' love and affection towards Achilles.
