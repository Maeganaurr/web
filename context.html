    <h2> 𓇢𓆸 Intertextual Roots</h2>
    <div class="scroll-box">
      <p>
        <em>The Song of Achilles</em> is strongly rooted in
        <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Iliad-epic-poem-by-Homer" target="_blank">
          Homer’s <em>Iliad</em>
        </a>,
        an ancient Greek epic that has influenced storytelling for thousands
        of years. The <em>Iliad</em> presents Achilles as a warrior driven by
        honor and rage, while Madeline Miller reshapes this portrayal by
        emphasizing his emotional vulnerability.
      </p>
      <p>
        This intertextual relationship allows readers to compare how the same
        characters and events can hold different meanings depending on who
        tells the story. Miller’s novel does not replace the original epic,
        but instead enters into a dialogue with it.

    <h2> ﴾ ﴿‏ Allusion in the Text</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout the novel, Miller relies on allusions to well-known elements
      of Greek mythology such as Achilles’ heel, the Trojan War, and the River
      Styx. These references assume a shared cultural understanding and allow
      the author to convey complex ideas efficiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a medieval context, such allusions function much like symbolic imagery
      in illuminated manuscripts—brief but powerful reminders of larger stories
      that deepen the reader’s interpretation.
